      "But there's more. This modpack includes quite a few sub-mods of create, greatly expanding the capabilities of create. For example, you can build a multiblock blast furnace structure, forge steel with it and craft machines with the produced steel to extract oil! Then you can refine the oil into fuels to power your machines, or synthetic materials that can be used in exciting ways.",
