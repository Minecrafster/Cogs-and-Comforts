	 - A dictionary of all possible metals and alloys to tell you which is which and which can do what.

## Optimization
I put every single optimization mod that would fit on forge here, so you can enjoy the scenery while worrying less about your computer spontaneously combusting. You can even add shaders to make the scenery more enjoyable and take beautiful screenshots!

If your PC is still burning try turning distant horizons off. 

Do note that due to the amount of mods some things might break. I haven't playtested every nook and cranny yet, so backup frequently. If you find a bug or have a suggestion you can report it at our discord server.
